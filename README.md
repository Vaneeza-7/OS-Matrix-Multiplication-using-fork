# OS-Matrix-Multiplication-using-fork

The repository contains the code to multiply two matrices using fork.

The program creates a new process for multipication of each row and saves the result of each row inside a file with the process id.
In the end, the program reads all the files to construct the final matrix. 

NOTE: The matrix size and values are calculated randomly.
